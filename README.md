# Welcome to the Spotmaze Repository
Spotmaze is a virtual world creation platform that enables you to build and customize your own personalized virtual worlds.

## How it works?
You first create a grid of connected locations and pathways. These are meant to represent any topics that are closely related. Each location can be then be linked to a forum, where you can receive responses from your community. You can then share this world using a simple URL.

## Launch your world
- To launch your world, fork this repository and the "[spotmaze.json](https://github.com/spotmaze/spotmaze/blob/main/spotmaze.json)" file into your own repository. 
- You repo name must be "[spotmaze](https://github.com/spotmaze/spotmaze)". 
- To see the world, go to your custom URL [https://spotmaze.world/spotmaze](https://spotmaze.world/spotmaze)
- To refresh your world, you can rename your file to "[room1.json](https://github.com/spotmaze/spotmaze/blob/main/room-1.json)"  
- Use your URL with a queery parameter(?) 
- For eg [https://spotmaze.world/spotmaze?room1](https://spotmaze.world/spotmaze?room1). 

## Customize your world
- You can customize your world by editing the appropriate fields in your [spotmaze.json](https://github.com/spotmaze/spotmaze/blob/main/spotmaze.json) file. 
- To add images into your world, you can drag and drop your Image folder into the repository, 
- Then add "[Images/my-img.png](https://github.com/spotmaze/spotmaze/tree/main/Images)" into the locations the image field. 

## Customize your world (using an Excel Spreadsheet)
- You also customize your world using Excel spreadsheet. 
- After editing, upload your custom [Excel file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q0a8-2sIvj7IQSQ2C1mAVWkEygv6768o/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101583459295701473733&rtpof=true&sd=true) to this [Excell converter](https://beautifytools.com/excel-to-json-converter.php) to convert your XLSX to JSON. 
- This website (https://beautifytools.com/excel-to-json-converter.php) will build you a valid JSON that you can use as your source file.
- Copy & paste this output into your existing JSON source file to compleate the process.
- Or else replace the current file with the newly created one from the website.
- Your XLSX format should match the standard format as shown here in this [repository file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spotmaze/spotmaze/main/spotmaze.xlsx)
